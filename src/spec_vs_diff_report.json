  "summary": "The diff adds a Motoko migration module introducing optional offerPrice/message on OrderRequest, updates backend types to include these fields, and updates the buyer OrderRequestForm plus the order-request hooks to send the new parameters. The admin orders panel was modified, but the truncated diff does not conclusively show the rendering of offer/message or that backend createOrderRequest persists them.",

    {
      "description": "Added status filtering UI for admin order requests (filter dropdown and empty-state variations), which is not required by REQ-9.",
      "reason": "REQ-9 only asks to display the buyer’s offer price/message and keep accept/reject working; filtering by status is extra behavior.",
